You can learn more about it in [the specification](http://bsonspec.org).

### Release Integrity

Releases are created automatically and signed using the [Node team's GPG key](https://pgp.mongodb.com/node-driver.asc). This applies to the git tag as well as all release packages provided as part of a GitHub release. To verify the provided packages, download the key and import it using gpg:

```shell
gpg --import node-driver.asc
```

The GitHub release contains a detached signature file for the NPM package (named
`bson-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig`).

The following command returns the link npm package. 
```shell
npm view bson@vX.Y.Z dist.tarball 
```

Using the result of the above command, a `curl` command can return the official npm package for the release.

To verify the integrity of the downloaded package, run the following command:
```shell
gpg --verify bson-X.Y.Z.tgz.sig bson-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

>[!Note]
No verification is done when using npm to install the package. The contents of the Github tarball and npm's tarball are identical.

Bug reports in JIRA for the NODE driver project are **public**.

## Usage

To build a new version perform the following operations:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Node.js or Bundling Usage

When using a bundler or Node.js you can import bson using the package name:

```js
import { BSON, EJSON, ObjectId } from 'bson';
// or:
// const { BSON, EJSON, ObjectId } = require('bson');

const bytes = BSON.serialize({ _id: new ObjectId() });
console.log(bytes);
const doc = BSON.deserialize(bytes);
console.log(EJSON.stringify(doc));
// {"_id":{"$oid":"..."}}
```

### Browser Usage

If you are working directly in the browser without a bundler please use the `.mjs` bundle like so:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { BSON, EJSON, ObjectId } from './lib/bson.mjs';

  const bytes = BSON.serialize({ _id: new ObjectId() });
  console.log(bytes);
  const doc = BSON.deserialize(bytes);
  console.log(EJSON.stringify(doc));
  // {"_id":{"$oid":"..."}}
</script>
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install bson
```
